# VideoGameCatalogue

# Project Summary
This is a personal side project I made to track a catalogue of video games and various other relationships

## Installation
1. Dependencies

	- Flask (```pip install flask```)
	- Sqlite3 (```pip install sqlite3```)

2. Run the python file: server.py (```> python3 server.py```)

3. Click on the link that appears on the terminal screen

	- It uses localhost with `port 5000`
	- If clicking on the link doesn't work you should be able to run the application then in a browser navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000
